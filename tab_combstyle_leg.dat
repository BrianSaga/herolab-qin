  <!-- csComStyle portal
        Presents a dynamic table where the user can add and adjust skills for the
        character.

        We use the "SimpleItem" template for selecting the skills, since all we need
        is basic information. We use a custom template for showing the selected
        skills to allow adjustment of the die type and any other customizations that
        are needed (e.g. domains for the Knowledge skill).

        We use an "additem" script to highlight whether more skill points can be
        assigned. This requires that we specify the "addthing" referenced in the
        script, which is the resource for tracking skill points.

        We use "candidate" tag expression to exclude all skills that are expressly
        hidden from user selection, such as those associated with arcane backgrounds.
        All skills that are added to the character are displayed, including those
        added via arcane backgrounds. We simply preclude their selection here.

        We use a "titlebar" script to replace the default title on the choose form
        with something that includes the summary information as helpful feedback to
        the user.

        We use a "headertitle" script to place a suitable title above the table. The
        title includes an indication of how many skill points have been utilized and
        how many remain, with appropriate color highlighting to prompt the user.

        appropriate edit portal so the user can enter the domain. Skills can also
        be deleted and have a mouse-over info icon.

        This layout orchestrates the display of the visual elements that comprise
        the Taos tab. This amounts to a title at the top and a dynamic table below
        where the user can add and adjust the skills he wants.

        The logic for this layout is similar to (albeit much simpler than) the
        logic for the Basics tab. So please refer to the Basics tab for more details.
