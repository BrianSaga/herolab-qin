In order to keep his free will, the latter must win a Opposed Resistance Test against Earth + level in this Tao of the Character. If he fails, he obeys all orders given by the character for a period in hours equal to the character’s Fire level. These orders must be given clearly and precisely. The person under control obeys them always to the letter, without trying to deduce the meaning. In a situation of indecision, he then refrains from any action. Finally, if the character wishes to force his victim to commit acts which would put in danger either his life or that of those near him, or which would greatly offend his moral values, the victim may attempt a second Opposed Resistance Test to regain control of himself at the opportune moment.">
