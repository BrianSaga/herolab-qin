<!-- This file contains the assortment of special abilities for the game system.
      Abilities confer their effects through scripts that apply the necessary changes
      to the appropriate traits.

      Abilities influence traits, so all adjustments must be applied prior to when the
      final trait value is calculated. The script timing used below (PreTraits/5000)
      ensures that we satisfy this requirement. All abilities should be designated as
      "unique" so that they can only be selected a single time by the user.

There are also certain yao who, even in their human forms, remain strongly marked by their animal side and have particularly visible marks: a yao-buffalo might have horns, a yao-tiger might be marked with black stripes all over their body, a yao-rat might have a tail, etc.">
