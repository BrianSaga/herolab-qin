		description="{B}Effects:{/B} (action) The character rapidly whirls his stick in front of him. All his opponents are held at bay and not one of them can safely attack the hero. Indeed, any enemy who attempts to penetrate the defensive circle to strike the character is automatically subjected to the number of damage points equal to the damage inflicted by the weapon (so rapidly does the stick sweep this zone) and is subjected to a penalty on his attack Test equal to the character’s Bangshu Level. However, the character cannot use any direct attack with his weapon as long as he is using this technique, nor add other Taos or Techniques, but he can defend himself and move normally. The only damage that he can inflict is that which the aggressors suffer when they attempt to strike him. The character may maintain this Technique as long as he likes, but must pay for the cost of it in Chi at the start of each use.{br}{br}{B}Secondary Effects:{/B} The rapid movements of the stick through the air cause swirls of vapor around the character.">

However, attacks from a distance can strike him, but in this case he is considered protected by a cover of +2.

		description="{B}Effects:{/B}(action) Fu Xia developed this curious way of using his shield almost by chance. Caught in an ambush, he managed to flee by sliding on his shield down the snow-covered slope of the pass where he had been surprised. The character can move in this way standing on his shield down any slope, however steep, for a number of yards equal to (5 + Dunshu Level) per turn. In each turn during which he advances like this, he must succeed in a Test of Water + Acrobatics against an ST of 7 or in close combat in this position but may, however, use a throwing or shooting weapon with an increase of ST +1. Should he wish to cross a stretch of water in this way, this movement can no longer be added from turn to turn and he will have to stop his advance as soon as the turn ends after (5 + Dunshu) yards. Finally, such use reduces, permanently, by one point the resilience of the shield.{br}{br}{B}Secondary Effects:{/B} Showers of sparks shoot out from under the shield during this movement.">
