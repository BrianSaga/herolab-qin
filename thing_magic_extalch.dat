A person whose body is covered with it becomes impervious to external impurities and therefore completely resistant to disease. The lotion cannot cure an established disease, but should prevent the user catching a disease in the first place.\n\n One of the specificities of the lotion is that it works by penetrating deep into the skin. This means that it does not wash off, and normally lasts a week. Those who can afford regular applications can therefore be wellprotected against illness.\n\n For the duration of the location’s effects, the user obtains a bonus equal to the alchemist’s External Alchemy Level on his Resistance Tests against the Contagiousness of a disease.">
