<!-- This file contains the assortment of special abilities for the game system.
      Abilities confer their effects through scripts that apply the necessary changes
      to the appropriate traits.

      Abilities influence traits, so all adjustments must be applied prior to when the
      final trait value is calculated. The script timing used below (PreTraits/5000)
      ensures that we satisfy this requirement. All abilities should be designated as
      "unique" so that they can only be selected a single time by the user.
