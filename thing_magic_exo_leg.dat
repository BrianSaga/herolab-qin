Then, when he so wishes, he releases the entire Yang light stored up. For this, he must spend 8 Chi points, and use an action in a combat situation.{br}{br} Any supernatural creature finding itself dazzled by this light becomes blind (even its supernatural senses such as the capability of a jiang shi to detect breath are wiped out) for the period of minutes equal to the exorcist’s Fire level, plus any length of time from an extra investment of Chi. A creature so blinded is subject to all the related penalties and very often finds itself impotent and at the mercy of the exorcist.{br}{br} A supernatural creature expecting to suffer this technique could attempt to avoid its effects by succeeding in a Resistance Test against an ST equal to (Fire + Exorcism) of the exorcist.">

If the creature, of its own free will, submits itself to the Judgment of Heaven, the Test can be ignored, but the exorcist still spends his Chi.{br}{br} A ghost without any evil intent, brought before the court of the celestial gods, has its curse removed and goes back directly to the Wheel of Reincarnation in order to be quickly reborn. A ghost who has fallen into evil, however, is delivered into the hands of the Judges of Hell and suffers a thousands tortures in the {i}Feng Du{/i} before it can be reincarnated, once purified.{br}{br} A peaceful {i}Yao{/i} submitted to the Judgment of Heaven earns the right to live as a human; it loses all its abilities and all its supernatural powers but its soul becomes fully human, thus making him impervious to the spells and techniques that target creatures and allowing it to integrate into the world of men without fearing, one day, being unmasked and rejected. An evil Yao, on the other hand, regresses and reverts to its original animal shape, losing as a consequence all its abilities and all its supernatural powers. It becomes a simple animal again and has to live the rest of its life as such.">
