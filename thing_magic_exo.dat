But only events which took place less than a century ago can be identified. To use this technique, the exorcist must close his eyes and focus his mind on picking up the traces of supernatural energy in the area. He must perform a successful Test of Earth + Exorcism, whose ST will depend on the power of the supernatural event which took place in the effective area. Generally, the ST will be 5 for something as dramatic as a passage to the Ten Hells, but as high as 11 for the simple invocation of a minor spirit. If he passes the Test he succeeds in finding the precise location of the unearthly event and, through partial visions of the past, gains a general idea of what occurred and when.

		description="The experienced exorcist has the ability to create talismans to protect temples and dwelling-houses against intrusions by malevolent beings of the world beyond. To do so, he must write the appropriate ritual formula in red ink on a bamboo sheet, and so create a talisman with the power to repel supernatural creatures. When placed above the main entrance to a building, the talisman will prevent any such creature from entering. In creating the talisman, the exorcist must specify which type of creature it will be effective against : the undead (including ghouls and jiang shi), ghosts, demons, Yao, or other types of spirits. The more precise the definition, the more limited the range of the talisman, but the more effective the talisman. If the exorcist writes the precise name of a particular demon, then his talisman will cause great problems for that demon, but will not work against any others. Once the talisman has been drawn, the exorcist must breathe his will into it by spending 6 Chi points. A talisman will only work when placed above the main entrance to the building or property to be protected. An extremely large dwelling with several entrances will need several talismans : each pavilion in a palace complex or outbuilding within a manor is treated as a separate building for these purposes. Each talisman only works for one day. But the power of the sacred language embodied in the talisman works in all directions, so it is possible to enclose a creature in a building and use a talisman at the exit to prevent it leaving. For so long as the talisman remains in place above the entrance, each creature covered by the sacred formula who attempts to pass through its shield must perform an Earth Test against an ST of the exorcist’s (Earth + Exorcism), or the exorcist’s (Earth x 2 + Exorcism) if the talisman refers to it by name. The ST may be increased where the exorcist has invested extra Chi. Should the creature succeed, it defeats the force of the talisman and passes through the shield. Should it fail, not only does it fail to enter the building, but it also suffers damage equal to the difference between its result and the ST. This damage cannot be reduced by Invulnerability or Natural Armor, and may be increased where the exorcist has invested extra Chi. A creature may only try to pass through a talisman of protection once per hour.">

		description="An exorcist can confine formless spirits such as ghosts and some demons, provided that they have not taken possession of a person or object, in any vessel that can be closed. To do so, the exorcist must spend 7 Chi points and meditate for a double hour, holding the vessel close to him in order to transfer his Yang energy to it. Thereafter, whenever he finds himself in the presence of a formless creature (such as one using the power of Formlessness), he need only open the vessel and it will generate such a powerful attraction for Yin energy in the atmosphere that the creature will be drawn towards it. To escape confinement, the creature may attempt an Earth Test against an ST determined by the nature and solidity of the vessel used (see table) plus any increase due to an extra investment of Chi. Once the creature is confined in the vessel, its powers become ineffective, and it may not attempt to escape for a period of days equal to the exorcist’s (Earth + Exorcism). At the end of this period, the creature may attempt another Test against the same ST as the first Test, but may find that the wise exorcist has sealed the vessel with Shield from the Souls of Sinners.\n\nST of the creature’s Earth Test: Umbrella or parasol 3\nLeather purse 5\nBamboo tube 7\nTerracotta jar 9\nJade box 11.">

		description="By sketching a pictogram depicting a trap in a precise location, and placing his own blood in it, the exorcist can create a zone in which any supernatural creature that passes through will be trapped and suffer terrible tortures. The exorcist draws the pictogram in dust or dye while invoking the vengeance of Heaven, then places a few drops of his own blood and spends 8 Chi points. The trap thus set extends in a circle whose radius in yards is equal to his Wood value, plus any additional distance deriving from an additional investment of Chi. Once the trap is set, any creature who sets foot within its perimeter, even one with the power of Formlessness, will be trapped. It can only escape by succeeding in an Earth Test whose ST will be equal to the exorcist’s (Earth + Exorcism) plus any increase due to an extra investment of Chi. Such a Test can only be attempted once per hour. While the creature is caught in the trap, it can move freely within the perimeter, but will be faced with an invisible barrier that prevents it from leaving. With the creature at his command, the exorcist can then call on the rage of Heaven against this impudent creature which dares to trespass on the world of men, by invoking the fire of Zhu Rong, god of vengeance. By spending 7 more Chi points, he can strike the creature with a mighty lightning bolt, inflicting damage of twice his Fire value plus any extra damage earned by an extra investment of Chi. The lightning strikes regardless of Formlessness, and slices through both Invulnerability and Natural Armor. In a combat situation, this action counts as an automatically successful attack.">

Before this technique can be used, the creature to be questioned must be under the control of the exorcist, whether imprisoned in an object, paralyzed by a talisman, or caught in a trap. Once this is done, the exorcist focuses all his will on the creature and asks a question. He must perform a successful Opposition Test of Fire + Exorcism against the creature’s Earth value. Should he succeed, the creature is obliged either to give the correct response or, where appropriate, admit its ignorance. But should he fail, the creature’s mind takes over that of the exorcist, causing him to lose a number of Breath of Life boxes equal to the difference between the two Test results, less any protection provided by any additional investment of Chi.

<!-- The Rite of Exorcism -->

		compset="Magic"
		isunique="yes"
		description="This complex, sacred and mysterious ritual is the preserve of only the greatest exorcists. For it has the power to destroy the very essence and soul of a supernatural creature. However, it can only be performed in respect of intangible creatures that have taken possession of a person, who haunt a dwelling, or who have been made prisoner of an object. The exorcist solemnly prepares the ritual by arranging incense, talismans, blood and eggs on an altar. If the creature to be exorcised dwells in a building, the altar must be placed in that building. If the creature is inside a person or moveable object, then it must be brought to the altar. Then the exorcist pronounces a long litany of prayers, incantations and invocations, bringing all the force of his will to bear on the evil creature in an attempt to break its spirit and dismantle its very essence. The exorcist performs a Test of Earth + Exorcism against an ST equal to the creature’s Resistance, and spends 5 Chi points. If he succeeds, the creature suffers damage equal to the Success Margin plus any additional damage caused by an additional investment of Chi. But if he fails, the exorcist feels the full force of the evil of the creature, suffering damage equal to the difference between his result and the ST, less any protection supplied by an additional investment of Chi. Each spiritual attack, representing the desperate struggle between the soul of the exorcist and the essence of the creature, lasts a small hour. Any damage suffered by the creature is not normal damage, for it is the essence of the creature that the exorcist is dismantling piece by piece. So even if the creature escapes during the ritual, its Breath of Life will be permanently diminished. And if it fails to escape, it will be wiped from the face of the world, its soul destroyed forever, with all hope of reincarnation lost.">
