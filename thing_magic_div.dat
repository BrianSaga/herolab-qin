The higher the Success Margin, the clearer the symbols and the easier they are to decipher.\n\nThere are no limitations on the content of a message, and no specific rules as to its form. In all cases the message will be vivid, yet vague and opaque. And often the character will not fully understand the warning of the gods until it is too late.">

The images that come to him in dreams will be opaque and disordered, often no more than hazy visions of the forces at work in the universe.\n\nAfter considering whatever information is available on the individual, the diviner performs a Test of Earth + Divination. The ST will depend on the quantity and precision of the information available: it may be 5 where the person knows both his exact date and place of birth, but 13 where the person only knows what year he was born in. The horoscope will define in broad terms the person’s defining characteristics, and provide general information about the course that his life may follow, dates and periods likely to be auspicious and inauspicious, and the influences which will guide his destiny. Many people consult astrologers before getting married, to gain guidance from the stars on the best possible date for the wedding.">

He then studies the pattern and arrangement of the lines in order to comprehend the message that they contain.\n\n After concentrating for a small hour, the diviner performs a Test of Earth + Divination, with an ST of 9. If successful, he understands the message and can answer the questions of the person consulting him. Provided that the procedure set out in the Book of Changes has been properly followed, and the diviner’s attempt to read the message has succeeded, the message should appear as a short and reasonably concrete phrase, such as 'Do not fight this person, make him your friend', or 'Do not act before you are ready'.

The images that come to him in dreams will be opaque and disordered, often no more than hazy visions of the forces at work in the universe. Before going to sleep, the diviner meditates for a small hour and performs a Test of Earth + Divination, with an ST of 7. Where he succeeds, he will find in sleep the door to a world of visionary dreams. His dream will invariably concern something or somebody connected either to the diviner or to the place in which he is sleeping. He may for example sense a great threat, without knowing if the threat is yet to come or a shadow of the past. He may see a young woman commit suicide, but not know whether that in fact occurred in the spot where he sleeps, whether the fiancée of his most recent victim yearns to join him in the world beyond, or whether his own sister is destined to take her own life. The higher the Success Margin on the Test, the sharper the vision and the easier it is to interpret. The drawback of this technique is that a night disturbed by vivid, lifelike dreams is far from a perfect night’s rest. The character only regains Breath of Life and Chi at half the normal rate.">

If he succeeds in a Test of Earth + Divination, with an ST of 11, he will start to see the blood form images and scenes of events from the future of the relevant person. These will be dark scenes, for the Mirror of Blood reflects only great misfortunes, tragic events and terrible deaths.

After succeeding in a Test of Earth + Divination, with an ST of 7, he will be able to inform that person of his relationship with the various Elements in the near future. For example, he may say that Water is inauspicious, or that Earth will support him. Statements taken from the Book of the Stars will be extremely vague, and it will be up to the player to interpret their meaning. But the higher his Success Margin, the more copious and detailed the information obtained. For instance, 'Water is inauspicious' may mean a variety of matters to a character, including a risk of drowning, the likelihood of floods destroying his crops, difficulties in drawing back his army, or even that someone is planning to poison him.">

If the energies are more or less in balance, then he notices nothing. But a significant imbalance always has a meaning : if a person is excessively Yang, for example, he may be violent or have a dominant personality. Ahouse filled with Yin energy may be haunted, or its inhabitants sick. The diviner might be able to obtain more information by using other Divination techniques, or his own powers of observation. But the Vision of the Taiji may give him a swift, intuitive advantage when faced with the unknown.">

He also becomes able to sense the dominant energies within a person. But a mere Apprentice has not yet learnt to distinguish between the internal and external forms of the Elements, so while he may sense Metal within a person, he will be unable to say if that is because the person is a great warrior or because he is carrying iron weapons. The range of the diviner’s elemental sense depends on his Success Margin. Each point in the Success Margin gives the diviner ten yards’ range.">

To prepare the Wall, the diviner must place various objects at the cardinal points of the area to be protected. In the center, he should place an object related to the Earth (such as a stone or a jade statue) ; to the North, an object related to Water (a bowl of water or a snowball) ; to the East, an object related to Wood (a plant or wooden tool) ; to the South, an object related to Fire (hot coals or a torch) ; and finally to the West, an object related to Metal (an iron weapon or a bronze tool). Next, the diviner must solemnly invoke each of the Five Guardians in turn and spend 8 Chi points. The barrier is formed : when it is crossed, for example by a person passing through it, the diviner is immediately made aware of precisely where the crossing took place. If he is asleep, he is immediately awakened to receive this information. The barrier lasts until it is crossed or the diviner leaves the area inside it.">

He must have a definite connection with the person or object. For a person, he must either have met him, or possess an item of his clothing, or have a member of the person’s family with him. For an object, it is enough that he has held it for a short time. The technique depends on appropriate meditation and a successful Earth + Divination Test. This enables the diviner to sense the approximate location of a person or object, to know the state, mountain range, or river mouth where they can be found. He should also be able to gain a vague sensory impression relating to their environment. If, say, a weapon is locked in a chest buried underground, the diviner will feel the crushing weight of earth on it. If a person is in a palace, the diviner will sense the rich marble of the walls, the metal of the guards’ weapons, the throngs of courtiers. The diviner cannot hope for a precise address, or a clear name, but the higher his Success Margin, the clearer the indication of location and the more distinct the impressions of the target’s environment.">

The diviner meditates for a small hour and performs a Test of relevant Aspect + Divination against an ST of 7. This establishes a connection and facilitates contact with an individual spirit that dwells in nature. The Aspect to be used in the Test depends on the kind of spirit to be contacted : Water for the spirit of a lake, Wood for a forest spirit, Earth for the spirit that guards the stone at the center of a village, and so on. The higher the Success Margin, the better-disposed the spirit will be to communicating with the mortal. Note that the simple spirits of the natural world have an understanding of life that has little in common with that of men, and that their vision of the world will be defined and limited by their place within it. For a plant knows little beyond the fact that night follows day and the order of the seasons, a stone has no notion of time, and neither can tell a human from a non-human, excepting maybe those humans who have learnt to speak with them.

These are beings of infinite age, whose concerns are far higher than the affairs of men, and who will resent being disturbed over a trifling matter. A God cannot be tricked into revealing more information than he wishes, and the word of a God is not to be challenged. A man must be content to entreat the Gods humbly for their guidance. Moreover, although the knowledge of the Gods is vast and their wisdom profound, few of them pay any great mind to the world of men ; as a result, it is not unknown for Gods to be ignorant or mistaken on earthly matters.">

		description="This rare and extremely potent technique permits a spirit or ancestor to appear in the real world and act directly in it. The diviner opens the gates of his body to a particular spirit, who enters, takes over, and inhabits his body, leaving the diviner himself in a semi-conscious state. For so long as the technique takes effect, the spirit has complete control of the body, speaking directly through its mouth, and behaving as if it were his own. While the spirit has access to many of his own powers, the extent to which he can use them will of course be restricted by the physical limitations of the body. For however great the powers of the spirit, he must act within the confines of his earthly form. A spirit can only inhabit a body for a period in hours equal to the diviner’s (Earth + Divination). At the end of this period, the spirit leaves the body and the diviner comes to, with only very vague memories of the possession.">
