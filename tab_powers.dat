  <!-- pwPower portal
        Presents a dynamic table where the user can add special abilities for the
        character.

        We use the "SimpleItem" template for selecting the special abilities, since
        all we need is basic information. We use a custom template for showing the
        selected abilities to highlight auto-added picks based on race selections.
        In conjunction with this, the "fixedlast" attribute forces all non-deletable
        picks (i.e. those that are auto-added) to be shown at the bottom of the list.

        We use an "additem" script to highlight whether more abilities need to be
        selected. This requires that we specify the "addthing" referenced in the
        script, which is the resource for tracking abilities.

        We use a "candidate" tag expression to limit the choices the user can make.
        If omitted, all things derived from the "Ability" component will be shown
        to the user for selection. Using this tagexpr allows us to omit all abilities
        that have the "Hide.Ability" tag. For example, the Flight ability needs to
        behave as a normal ability, but we only want it available to characters that
        select the "Avian" race. By assigning it the "Hide.Ability" tag and using
        the candidate tagexpr to omit those abilities, Flight cannot be chosen by
        non-Avian characters but it will also appear in the selected list if the
        character choosed the Avian race.

        We use a "titlebar" script to replace the default title on the choose form
        with something more useful. Just like we did on the title portal above, we
        include the summary information as helpful feedback to the user.

        We use a "description" script to generate the appropriate information for
        display to the user as a description when choosing special abilities. We
        call a general procedure for the game system for this purpose.

        We use a "headertitle" script to place a suitable title above the table.
        The title includes an indication of how many selections have been chosen
        and how many remain, with appropriate color highlighting to prompt the user.

        sorted and colored differently to distinguish their nature.
