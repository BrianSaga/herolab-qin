First, the practitioner may only use it for a maximum number of consecutive nights equal to his Internal Alchemy Level. After this time, he must again get a whole night’s sleep. Second, since the practitioner is not asleep, he cannot recover Chi or Breath of Life for so long as he stays awake.">

This involves a Test of Wood + Internal Alchemy against an ST which will depend on the rarity of his affliction.

If he passes the Test, he identifies at least partly the cause of his suffering.\n\n Next, using his own diagnosis or that provided by a physician, the practitioner meditates a second time to heal himself. This involves a Test of the relevant Aspect + Internal Alchemy, against an ST equal to the Virulence of the disease or poison, and spending a number of Chi points equal to the same Virulence value. The relevant Aspect is determined by the nature of the disease or poison. It will be Fire for 'hot' diseases, Water for “cold” diseases, Wood for plant-based poisons, and Earth or Metal for mineral-based poisons.\n\n If the practitioner passes the Test, the disease or poison is driven out of his body.

Even where he succeeds in connecting to the mind of his target, the practitioner will only be able to read conscious, clear and easily accessible thoughts. It is only by spending more Chi that he will gain access to the deeper levels of the target’s mind, such as those that hold hidden thoughts, memories, unconscious thoughts, and so on. But at any level, he will be able to project his own thoughts and messages to the target’s mind, in the form of short phrases, sounds or images.\n\n Generally, people do not realize that their minds are being read, and assume that any thoughts that come into their head are their own, taking them to be the fruit of unconscious reflection or sudden intuition. However, there are some extraordinary individuals who are able to sense a mental connection, mainly Taoists highly skilled in Divination or Internal Alchemy, but occasionally others blessed with particularly sharp minds. To find out whether such a person senses the mental connection, the Games Master can make him perform a Test of Earth (+ Divination or Internal Alchemy) with an ST equal to the result of the practitioner’s Earth + Internal Alchemy Test.

This includes the use of Taos and Magic and the calculation of damage. Secondary Aspects are unaffected.">
